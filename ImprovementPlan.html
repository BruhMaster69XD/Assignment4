 <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We were tasked with designing a website capable of e-commerce(Kind of). Our mission was to sell popular phones to our customers.<br>
 The main object of our website was a table that was capable of dynamically allocating data from both users and the database it was lnked to.<br>
 Additionally for attractions purposes we included other cool features such as facts and information aswell as a subscription to our other information services. <br>
The giant and obvious limitation to this website is that everything in it, is superficial. We do not actually distribute any subscriptions, any information on our <br>
website is factually incorrect and the products we claim to sell are all not real. The actual functionality of our website is close to flawless, the exceptions to this are all listed below. 
 Additionally the css design we used could be considered very offputting and since it is a website designed to attract customers this could potentially be very harmfull to our buisness model.<br>  </p>
