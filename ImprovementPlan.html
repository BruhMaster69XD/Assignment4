 <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We were tasked with designing a website capable of e-commerce(Kind of). Our mission was to sell popular phones to our customers.
 The main object of our website was a table that was capable of dynamically allocating data from both users and the database it was lnked to.
 Additionally for attractions purposes we included other cool features such as facts and information aswell as a subscription to our other information services. 
The giant and obvious limitation to this website is that everything in it, is superficial. We do not actually distribute any subscriptions, any information on our 
website is factually incorrect and the products we claim to sell are all not real. The actual functionality of our website is close to flawless, the exceptions to this are all listed below. 
 Additionally the css design we used could be considered very offputting and since it is a website designed to attract customers this could potentially be very harmfull to our buisness model.  </p>

<h1>Accesibility Highlights</h1>
<h2> Percievable</h2>
<p> Our contents on the website are purely text and image based. No other forms of media are included what so ever. Additional information to 1.1, 1.3 and 1.4 will be discussed 
in our appendix. Any other information mentioned or included </p>
<h2> Operable</h2>
<p> The mechanism of our website is not based of any time commands additionally we do not include any seizure indusing content in our website 
 so the only relevant information in 2.1 and 2.4 will be discussed later on in our appendix </p>
<h2>Undersatandable</h2>
<p>The contents of our website are readable (only in english), and the design of the website is relatively easy to navigate. We do not find ourselfs responsible to 
make the website understandable for the mentally and physically impaired as we were working with time constraints.</p>
<h2>Robust</h2>
<p>Parsing and the functionalty of our markup language can be considered functioning. We have no duplicated in codes or tags and our syntax is to its most part also correct. 
but since were only marked on the functionality of website and not its rebustness to bugs and abuses this section of the guidelines does not concern us.</p>


 <h2>Appendix A</h2>
<table id="appendix_a">
 <thead>
  <th><strong>GUIDELINES:</strong></th>
  <th><strong>1.1</strong></th>
  <th><strong>1.3</strong></th>
  <th><strong>1.4</strong></th>
  <th><strong>2.1</strong></th>
  <th><strong>2.4</strong></th>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td></td>
   <td>Our page complies with guideline 1.1, because the only situation our page uses is the "controls, input" in our dynamic table.<br> Our dynamic table uses user input
   and has names for what kind of input the table is expecting, for example, the input box for brand in the <br> brand columnn and so are the other input
   boxes in their respective columns. Our page also has a input box for the user to write their email if they want to receive subscribtion from us about new products.</td>
   <td>We do believe that our page complies with the guidelines of 1.3, because our page is adaptabe without losing information or structure. We say this because we have the appendix
   at the top of the page, which leads you directly to where you want to go within the page. So if you want to change the page to a much simpler layout, the information or structure or meaning
   will not be lost because of the appendix. Our page also does not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components.</td>

   <td>"explanation for guideline 2.1"</td>
   <td>"explanation for guideline 2.4"</td>
