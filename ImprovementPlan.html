<h1><center>Self Evaluation report</center></h1>
<h3><center>lab:122</center></h3>

 <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We were tasked with designing a website capable of e-commerce(Kind of). Our mission was to sell popular phones to our customers.
 The main object of our website was a table that was capable of dynamically allocating data from both users and the database it was lnked to.
 Additionally for attractions purposes we included other cool features such as facts and information aswell as a subscription to our other information services. 
The giant and obvious limitation to this website is that everything in it, is superficial. We do not actually distribute any subscriptions, any information on our 
website is factually incorrect and the products we claim to sell are all not real. The actual functionality of our website is close to flawless, the exceptions to this are all listed below. 
 Additionally the css design we used could be considered very offputting and since it is a website designed to attract customers this could potentially be very harmfull to our buisness model.  </p>

<h1>Accesibility Highlights</h1>
<h2> Percievable</h2>
<p> Our contents on the website are purely text and image based. No other forms of media are included what so ever. Additional information to 1.1, 1.3 and 1.4 will be discussed 
in our appendix. Any other information mentioned or included </p>
<h2> Operable</h2>
<p> The mechanism of our website is not based of any time commands additionally we do not include any seizure indusing content in our website 
 so the only relevant information in 2.1 and 2.4 will be discussed later on in our appendix </p>
<h2>Undersatandable</h2>
<p>The contents of our website are readable (only in english), and the design of the website is relatively easy to navigate. We do not find ourselfs responsible to 
make the website understandable for the mentally and physically impaired as we were working with time constraints.</p>
<h2>Robust</h2>
<p>Parsing and the functionalty of our markup language can be considered functioning. We have no duplicated in codes or tags and our syntax is to its most part also correct. 
but since were only marked on the functionality of website and not its rebustness to bugs and abuses this section of the guidelines does not concern us.</p>

 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>1.1</td>
   <td>Our page complies with guideline 1.1, because the only situation our page uses is the "controls, input" in our dynamic table.<br> Our dynamic table uses user input
   and has names for what kind of input the table is expecting, for example, the input box for brand in the <br> brand columnn and so are the other input
   boxes in their respective columns. Our page also has a input box for the user to write their email if they want to receive subscribtion from us about new products.
   </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>1.3</td>
   <td>We do believe that our page complies with the guidelines of 1.3, because our page is adaptabe without losing information or structure. We say this because we have the appendix
   at the top of the page, which leads you directly to where you want to go within the page. So if you want to change the page to a much simpler layout, the information or structure or meaning
   will not be lost because of the appendix. Our page also does not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
        <td>1.4</td>
       <td>We fail to comply with most of the requirements in guideline 1.4. This is because e.g. we have not implemented any audio on our page(so this requirement does not apply to us), we do not meet the requirements
    for the contrast (minimum and enhanced), because we simply did not know at the time that such contrast ratios were required, our use of color is mostly only for decoration, we do meet the
    requirement to resize text, by pressing "ctrl +", which will increase size of the text on the page, our page does not include images of text, so this requirements does not apply to us,
    and lastly for the visual presentation we only meet the resize text point, because we didn't implement any foreground and background colors that could be selected by the users,
    our line spacing is not at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs and our text is only aligned to the left margin.
    </td>       
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2.1</td>
       <td>Our website fully supports the use of keyboard and mouse. There are no underlying techniques for the user to submit or create text other than using the characters given on the keyboard.
       for example recognition of mouse drawn characters are not supported on our website. Additionally we do not use any internal commands which could potentially trap the user in a permanent zoomed in state.
       All functionality that would modify the perspectives of the website are handled through the local browser, which we assume to be perfectly functioning. And to stress this once more all thigs
       that are operable on our website can be operated with a keyboard.</td>       
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2.4</td>
       <td>Although we do not repeat any content on our singular webpage, we do give the user the functionality to skip to the snippit of content that they wish to view. All of the content we provide
       (if allocated to a different subject) will be titled with the relevant topic to its content(this includes webpages, headings and titles). Additional the bypass (linked to the appendix) is sorted in chronological order allowing the user to always retain focus.
       Every hyperlinks text gives reference to what kind of content or webpage they are being sent to. Because our website only consist of one singular webpage one cannot navigate to other webpages. Our website also allows keyboard focus but a limitation to this focus
       is that you can only navigate to places on the webpage that allow user interaction. The titles and headers within our webpage serve as location finding objects.</td>
